# Faculty - Feedback System
It is a feedback system where students give their study on their corresponding faculties over a semester. These reviews are retrieved, and specific calculations are performed, and a pie-chart is plotted. This pie-chart supports the higher authorities to investigate the faculty performance, which will, in turn, helps them to smoothen the teaching-learning process. Here student can only review the analytics of the feedbacks that he has given. And the teacher/faculty can review his/her performance.
